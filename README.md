# DNA Sequencing using Machine Learning
 DNA is a hereditary material in humans and most of the organisms. A human genome has about 6 billion characters or letters. If you think the genome(the complete DNA sequence) is like a book, it is a book about 6 billion letters of “A”, “C”, “G” and “T”. Now, everyone has a unique genome. Nevertheless, scientists find most parts of the human genomes are alike to each other.
 
In this project ,a classification model is created that trains on the human DNA sequence and can predict a gene family based on the DNA sequence of the coding sequence. To test the model, we will use the DNA sequence of humans, dogs, and chimpanzees and compare the accuracies.
